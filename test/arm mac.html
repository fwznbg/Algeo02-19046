APPLE’S ‘ONE MORE THING’ ARM MAC EVENT LIVE BLOG
Apple silicon for Macs is finally here

At WWDC in June, Apple announced it would begin a two-year transition to using its own processors on Macs this year. True to its word, it has one last event in 2020, titled “One More Thing” after Steve Jobs’ famous catchphrase.

We are absolutely expecting Arm-based processors for Macs. Specifically, Bloomberg has reported that the first ones to arrive will be a new MacBook Air and a new 13-inch MacBook Pro. Releasing a MacBook Pro, in particular, seems to imply that Apple has a high degree of confidence in how powerful its new chips will be.

Even so, there are many questions Apple will need to answer. How well will apps designed for Intel processors work with Apple’s Rosetta 2 translation layer? Will iPad apps on the Big Sur operating system feel like they belong there at all? Will Apple go for the longer battery you can sometimes expect from Arm processors or crank up the power and keep battery life about the same? Will there be any sort of redesign?

We hope to find out all of those answers very soon. The event kicks off at 10AM PT / 1PM ET, and we’ll be live-blogging all of the announcements from the live stream.
